The License the Holder is receiving is solely for the Licensed NFT High Rollers which includes the right to use the Licensed NFT High Rollers and the right to reproduce the Licensed NFT High Rollers on tribute or derivative art, merchandise, or sharing these rights with third party projects. The Holder agrees not to use, utilize, portray, advertise, distribute or otherwise market any High Rollers in any project or derivative work that involves hate speech, racism, pornography, or any other illegal or unlawful content. Upon sale or transfer of the NFT, any ownership or commercial rights are immediately transferred to the new Holder. No refunds shall be issued to any Holder upon a full and complete lawful purchase of any NFT or High Rollers. In the event that any Holder purchases a High Roller through the secondary market, such as Solanart, Holder shall be held accountable and will be bound by the Terms of Service which govern said secondary market platform.</p>
